          We are lucky to have a space with one of the longest sandy beaches in
          the Sokhna area. The soft sand on the beach in the swimming area make
          it perfect for both kids and adults to enjoy, play, and swim. Let your
          imagination run free—build sandcastles, relax in the sun, or simply
          enjoy the refreshing sea breeze.
