          <div>
            Our story began back in <strong>2007</strong>, when we first
            discovered kitesurfing. What started as a hobby quickly became a
            passion that took over our free time. We traveled, explored new
            spots, and immersed ourselves in the kitesurfing lifestyle.

          <div>
            Years later, that passion evolved into offering professional
            kitesurfing courses and experiences. We searched for a place that
            would provide both comfort and convenience, where people could
            safely begin their kitesurfing journey while friends and family
            could relax and enjoy nature together.

            In 2020, after meeting <strong>Kai Sokhna</strong>, we knew we had
            found the perfect location. The spot offers ideal and safe
            conditions for learning kitesurfing, a long sandy beach, and a
            luxury restaurant and lounge—everything needed to enjoy a perfect
            day by the sea.
